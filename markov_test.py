"""
markov chain experimentation

call by giving a original set of word to start with (more than nbrkey)

The program cut the given text by word, based on space
It takes a certain number (nbrkey) of following words, for instance two
by two, and associate to this tuple another sequence of word of length
nbrvalue
finally it create a dictionary based on these associations and chain
them to generate the text

I personally populate "text_data.txt" with http://norvig.com/big.txt

Also try to use https://gist.github.com/yanofsky/5436496
